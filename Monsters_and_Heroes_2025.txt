CS 611 Legends: Monsters and Heroes  
In this assignment you will  implement a role-playing  game in Java using object -oriented principles and 
design . This is a magical game full of spells, monsters, and heroes . 
The monsters and heroes  live in a fictional world . They do not get along and therefore fight each other. 
Every time the heroes win, they gain experience and money. Heroes use the money to buy a variety of 
items to aid them in their battle s with the monsters. When they accumulate enough experience,  they 
level up , which improves  their skill s. The goal of the game is for the heroes to defeat monsters and  level 
up indefinitely.  
I. The World of Play  
 
The world of the game is represented by a  fixed, square grid of spaces. The grid contains 
three types of spaces:  
• Inaccess ible spaces, which the heroes cannot enter  
• Market spaces, where items can be bought or sold  
• Common spaces, where battles can occur  
Every time the heroes visit a common tile, there is a chance that they will engage in a battle 
with the monsters. These monst ers are not created when the map is created. Every time the 
heroes visit a space,  we "roll a di ce," and , if they are unlucky,  then the monsters are created 
and the battle begins  immediately .  
The party  of heroes is  always  located  in a specific space  of the grid . When not in a battle, the 
party  can move up, down , left, or right  to an adjacent space . The player can enter the 
market if the party is on a market space.  
An example world size is 8 spaces by 8 spaces. In this size our sug gestion is to have 20% 
inaccessible spaces , 30% market  spaces,  and 50% common spaces . 
 
II. The Battle  
 
The battle pits the party of heroes against a group of monsters. A battle consists of multiple 
rounds, where the heroes and monsters each make moves. The figh t ends when the HP of 
either all of the monsters or all of the heroes is zero. If the heroes win the fight, they earn 
money and experience, potentially leveling up . If the monsters win the fight, the game is 
over.  
The monsters are created at the beginning of the battle. Their level  should be scaled to the 
level  of the heroes.  There will be as many monsters as there are heroes . For example , if the 
player begins their adventure with two heroes, then every battle will be against  two 
monsters.  A mor e complex (and dangerous!) version might vary the number of monsters 
encountered  and the monsters’  levels . 
CS 611 Legends: Monsters and Heroes  
The heroes  move first  in each round . During the heroes’ turn, the player chooses for e ach 
hero whether they will do  one of the following : 
• Attack, using the hero’s equipped weapon  
• Cast a spell  from the hero’s inventory  
• Use a potion from the hero’s inventory  
• Equip a  weapon  or piece of armor  
In addition, at any time during the heroes’ turn, the player can display the stat istics (ex. 
strength, or base damage)  of a hero or a monster. This will not consume the turn.  Monsters 
have a base dodge chance, allowing them to occasionally avoid taking damage from an 
attack or a spell. If an attack or a spell lowers a monster’s HP to 0, that  monster is defeated 
and removed from the battle.  
After the heroes have made their moves, the monsters’ turn begins. The monsters will only 
attack the heroes, as they do n ot have items or spells to use. Heroes also have a dodge 
chance that will allow them to occasionally avoid taking damage from a monster’s attack. If 
a monster’s attack lowers a hero’s HP to 0, that hero will faint. Fainted heroes cannot take 
actions for the remainder of the battle.  
During the round , clearly show to the player  who took what  action and that action’s  result . 
For example: “Karl the Barbarian attacked the Red Dragon for 504 damage !”, “Merlin used a 
health potion and recovered 300 HP!” , or “The Giant Bug attacked Wallace the Lame for 120 
damage! Wallace the Lame fainted!”  
At the end of each round  (after the monsters’ turn) , heroes that have not fainted  regain 
some of their HP and mana.  
The heroes win the battle if they defeat all of the monsters. If the heroes win , they gain 
experience and money, and all fainted heroes are revived.  The experience gained should be 
scaled to the level of the monsters defeated. For example, a level 1 monster may grant 1 
experience point, while a level 10 monster may grant 10 experience  points. The money 
gained should also be scaled to the level of the monsters defeated. For example, a level 1 
monster may grant 100 gold, while a level 10 monster may grant 1000 gold. A fainted hero is 
revived with half of their HP and mana, but they will not gain any gold or experience.  
The battle has several ways that it can be fought. The simplest version would be a series of 
1-on-1 fights between an individual monster and an individual hero. A more complex 
version would be a full -team fight between the party and the monster group, where each 
combatant chooses their target when attacking.  There are many variations of these two 
ideas, as well as completely different ways to conduct the battle. The version you choose to 
implement needs only to allow for all  of the behavior specified above, namely that it is 
possible for all of the heroes to faint and for all of the monsters to be defeated.

III. The Heroes and Monsters  
The heroes of the world  have banded together into a party to fight monsters. At the start of 
the game, allow the player to choose how many heroes to play with.  There should be a limit 
to how many heroes there are in the party.  
A hero has  several attributes:  
• A name  
• A level  with  an amount of experience points  
• HP (hit points, the hero ’s in battle)  
• MP ( mana  or magic points, for casting spells)  
• A strength value  
• A dexterity value  
• An agility value  
• An amount of gold  
• An inventory of items  
The example rules section at the end of this document contains several formulae you can 
use for determining HP, MP, and the calculations involving strength, dexterity, and agility.  
Level and experience points.  A hero has a level, representing how strong (or not) that hero 
is. Experience points determine the hero’s level. A hero levels up after accumulating enough 
experience  points. A hero’s skills increase when the hero levels up.  A hero never loses 
experience. It accumulates over the course of the game.  
HP. HP is t he hero’s current health. For simplicity, the hero’s HP  does not have to be capped  
(have a maximum amount) . For example , in other games a hero has a maximum of 100  HP 
and cannot go over this limit  (it is said to be capped). So, i f the hero currently has 90 hp and 
uses a potion that increases  HP by 50 , then  the hero’s HP would now be come  100. In 
Monsters and Heroes  you can assume that the hero’s HP will be come  140 in the same 
scenario. The initial HP value is determined by hero’s level. When a hero levels up, they have 
their HP set according to the same formula . 
MP. MP (or mana) is used t o cast spells. For simplicity, the hero’s MP does not have to be 
capped (like HP). The initial MP value is determined by the hero’s level. When a hero levels 
up, they have their MP set according to the same formula.  
Strength.  A hero’s strength increases th e amount of damage they deal when using a 
weapon.   
Dexterity.  A hero’s dexterity increases the amount of damage they deal when casting a 
spell.  
Agility.  A hero’s agility inc reases their chance to dodge a monster’s attack.  
Gold. Gold represents the  hero ’s money  for use  in the market . 
CS 611 Legends: Monsters and Heroes  
Inventory.  A hero has a collection of items that they have bought during the game. At the 
start of the game, the inventory is empty.  For simplicity, there does not need to be a 
maximum inventory size.  
There are three types of he roes , each with their own balance of skills:  
• Warriors  are favored on strength and agility.  
• Sorcerers  are favored on dexterity and agility.  
• Paladins  are favored on strength and dexterity.  
A “favored ” skill will be increased more than normal  at the start of the game and on each 
level up . 
A monster has several attributes:  
• A name  
• A level  
• HP 
• A base damage  value  
• A defense value  
• A dodge  ability  
The example rules section contains formulae for the monster’s attributes that you can use in 
your game.  
Base damage.  For simplicity, a m onster ’s attack damage is calculated using this value . A 
more complex alternative would be to give the monster a strength value like a hero and a 
default “monster weapon” to deal damage with.  
Defense.  Monsters don’t we ar armor, relying on their natural hides and carapaces to 
protect them from the heroes’ attacks. This  value  reduces the amount of damage a monster 
takes from a hero’s attack or spell.  
Dodge ability . This represents how well  a monste r can  avoid a hero’s att ack. It functions in a 
similar way to the hero’s agility.  
 There are three kinds of monsters , each with a favored attribute :  
• Dragons  have increased  base damage.  
• Exoskeletons  have increased defense.  
• Spirits  have increased dodge ability . 
 
IV.The Market  
The heroes can buy and sell items  at any market . Each market in the world is unique and  
should have different items for sale. The market is a special menu where the player will be 
able to see all the items for sale with  their details (ex. price and level ).  
CS 611 Legends: Monsters and Heroes  
Heroes enter the market individually. Each hero has a private wallet  (their gold amount)  and 
does not share money with the other hero es. Likewise, each hero has their own inventory of 
items that they do not share with their fellow heroes.  A hero should be a ble to  sell an item  
in their inventory to the market, but only for less than the price for which it was bought (ex. 
for half the purchase price ). A successful purchase will reduce the amount of gold the hero 
has and  transfer the item from the market to the  hero’s inventory. A successful sale will 
increase the amount of gold the hero has and add that item to the market’s item list . This 
will allow other heroes to buy it, or for the selling hero to repurchase it  later . 
All items have a name, a price , and a level. A hero cannot buy : (1) an item that costs more 
than the money they have , or (2) an item that is a higher level than they are. The types of 
items in Monsters and Heroes are:  
• Weapons  
• Armor  
• Potion s 
• Spells 
Items should all have severa l uses before they are no longer useable. Once they are 
unusable, you can either replace them, or have them repaired at the market for half of the 
purchase price.  
Weapon s. A weapon is used by a hero to attack a monster. A w eapon has a name, a price , a 
level, a damage value, and the number of hands required to use it . A weapon must be 
equipped by the hero before it can be used. The damage value is used to calculate the 
damage dealt  during an attack move in a battle.  A weapon  may require one or two hands to 
be used (i.e. a bow requires two hands). The weapons requiring two hands must always be 
held with 2 hands. However, you can equip a one-handed weapon with both hands and 
doing so  should increase the strength of the weapon .  
Armor.  Armor reduce s the incoming damage from a monster’s attack. A piece of  armor has 
a name , a price,  a level, and a damage reduction value. When equipped, armor will reduce 
the damage taken by the hero by its damage reduction value. For simplicity you can assume 
that a hero can equip at most one piece of armor at a time. A more comple x version would 
have multiple armor slots and armor types for each slot.  
Potion s. Potions can be used by a hero to increase one of their statistics by some amount. 
Potions are single -use items : once they are used , potions  cannot be reused. Potions  have a 
name, a price,  a level , and an effect amount . Using the potion should increase the given 
statistic by the effect amount. There should  be potions for increasing HP, MP, strength, 
dexterity, and agility.  More complex potions could include defense potions , revival potions , 
or even a fire potion  (the possibilities are endless!). A more complex extension could include 
multi -use potions.  
Spell s. A spell represents a magic attack performed  by a hero. A spell has a name, a price , a 
level , a damage value, a mana  cost, and a spell type . A hero will require at least the mana  
cost amount of MP to cast the spell. Therefore, if a hero has no MP, that hero cannot cast 
any spells. The damage value i s used  along with the hero’s dexterity value  to calculate the 
CS 611 Legends: Monsters and Heroes  
damage dealt during a spell cast move in a battle. After casting a spell, the mana cost is 
deducted from the hero ’s MP . Spells also have an additional effect besides their damage. 
The types of spells  and their effects are : 
• Ice spell : reduces the damage of the target  
• Fire spell : reduces the defense of the target  
• Lightning spell : reduce s the dodge chance of the target  
Spells are consumable items : like potions, spells can only be used a certain numb er of 
times. For simplicity, you can make spells single -use items. A more complex version would 
make spells multi -use items.  
V. Controls  
Example  controls for Monsters and Heroes include:  
• W/w:  move up  
• A/a:  move left  
• S/s: move down  
• D/d:  move right  
• Q/q:  quit game  
• I/i: show information  
• M/m:  enter market  
WASD/wasd.  These keys can be used to move the party around the world. This only applies 
outside of a battle.  
Q/q. The player should be able to quit the game at any time by pressing this key.  
I/i. Outside of battle  this should show information about the her oes (their  level, their hp, 
their mana, their current exp erience points , their money , and their skill levels ). 
During a battle  this should show information about the heroes (their level, their hp, their 
mana and their currently equipped weapons and armors) and infor mation about the 
monsters (their level, their hp, their damage, their defense, and their dodge chance).  
Thus, the player should be able at any moment to display  the heroes’  information.  
M/m.  The heroes should only be able to enter a market if the party is located on a market 
space. This should open the market menu.  
Additionally,  when the heroes are outside of a market  or a battle, they should be able to 
check their inventories to change their  weapons or armor. They should also be able to 
consume a potion. The player should be able at any moment to display the map (the world).  
There should also be a way to visually represent  all of the tiles and their properties. This 
includes the presence of t he heroes’ party in a tile , whether  a tile is accessible , and if it 
contains a market . The player should be able at any moment to quit the game.  
Finally, please include in your game  the instructions for how to play. While you and I now 
know the keys used t o play the game, keep in mind while  coding that you might want to give 
this to your little brother who does not know any of this…  make it user -friendly.

VI.Example Rules  
The following rules are intended to be used in conjunction with the monsters, heroes, and 
items detailed in th e provided Legends_Monsters_Heroes.zip file available on Blackboard.  
There is no guarantee that the resulting game will be balanced or particularly fun to play 
when using these formulae.  There is no requirement to use these exact numbers or 
formulae. The example formulae:  
• Hero’s s pell damage  = 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑙_𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒_𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 +(𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦
10000)×𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑙_𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒_𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒  
• HP of monsters and heroes  = 𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙×100 
When a hero levels up,  this formula is used to reset their HP . 
• MP of the heroes when they level up = 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑎×1.1 
• Hero’s attack damage (with  weapon ) = (𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ+𝑤𝑒𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑛_𝑑𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒)×0.05 
• Hero’s dodge chance =  𝑎𝑔𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦×0.002 
• Monster ’s dodg e chance =  𝑑𝑜𝑑𝑔𝑒_𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒×.01 
• Experience points to level up = ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑜_𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙×10 
• When  a hero levels up all of their skills increase  by 5% and their favored skills increase 
by an extra 5% . 
• At the end of each  round of a battle  the heroes regai n 10% of their HP and 10% of their 
MP. That is, 𝐻𝑃=𝐻𝑃×1.1 and 𝑀𝑃=𝑀𝑃×1.1 
• Hero gold gain =  𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟 _𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙×100 for hero es who did not faint  
• Hero experience gain =  𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟_𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 ×2 
• Monster ’s skill loss caused by spell  effect  = 𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙×0.1 
• Monster’s level = level of highest -level hero in the party  
• Items sell for half of their purchase price.  
• The party size is between 1 and 3 heroes.

Assignment Logistics  and Final Notes  
The specification simulates a role-playing  game of skill.  
Implement the game using t he principles and practices of o bject-oriented design  as presented and 
discussed in lecture.  
The objective of this assignment is to identify and represent correct relations hips between classes while 
maintaining best practices in programming and OO design.  
Our focus  in grading will be on your OO structure and overall design, as well as how well you 
implemented those relationships. We will not be as focused on how strictly you  followed the rules of 
the game.  The rules are there as a guide and to make the whole experience more realistic, meaningful , 
and enjoyable. Feel free to get creative with additional functionalities given that you have fulfilled the 
existing requirements!  
The helper files you have received have not been tested for fairness and you are free to adjust those 
values. We will be demonstrating a working version of the game during discussion sessions this week to 
help clarify the requirements of the game. In additi on to the specification, the attached zip file contains 
the specifics for the heroes, monsters, weapons, armors, potions, and spells. You are always welcome to 
use your imagination  to add more or  use your own naming.  
Your code should implement the ability to read in the text files  for default attributes. These can be 
modified in game such as a hero leveling up, but at the start of the next game, values should reset to 
default.  
Please note that this is NOT a group assignment.  Your design and your implementat ion should be your 
own. Your program will be evaluated as follows:  
• Object Design, with an emphasis on:  
o Scalability  
o Extendibility  
• Implementation, with a specific emphasis on:  
o Usability  
o Readability  
o Best Practices  
Deliverables:  
• readme text file  
• Java source code  
 
A word of advice: Begin by understanding the game. The specification is long and wordy,  but it is up to 
you to flesh out the requirements. We will be doing an in-class  demonstration this week in discussion 
but come prepared with questions to e nsure you have a solid understanding of the requirements. Have 
fun and have a great adventure!!
